### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

Credit to [Antique Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-waystones) for the blaystones marker texture!

Also thanks to [Way2Way](https://modrinth.com/mod/way2wayfabric) for insights into wrangling the API.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
